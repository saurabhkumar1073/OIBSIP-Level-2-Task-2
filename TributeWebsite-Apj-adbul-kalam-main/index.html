          <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, (born October 15, 1931,
          Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and
          politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s
          missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from
          2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from
          the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence
          Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the
          Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of
          the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed
          and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the
          program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped
          earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni,
          India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, whichincorporated
          aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
